# Tunjay Akbarli - Innovator, Software Engineer, Compiler Engineer, Young Computer Pioneer

Welcome to my GitHub space where I share my journey in technology and innovation. As the designer of Azerbaijan's first programming language, NeXTCode, I am dedicated to creating tools that empower developers and make programming more accessible.

## üöÄ About Me
I'm Tunjay Akbarli, a visionary in the field of Software Development, Artifical Intellegence, Cloud Computing and Banking (Payments). My passion lies in pushing the boundaries of what's possible with code. With a rich background in programming and technology, I have embarked on a mission to contribute to the tech landscape of Azerbaijan and beyond.

### üåü Highlights
- Founder and Chief Executive Officer of NeXTHub.
- Designer of the first programming language of Azerbaijan, NeXTCode.
- A key player in expanding Azerbaijan's role on the Technology.

## üíª My Projects
Here's a snapshot of the innovative projects I've been working on:

### NeXTCode Programming Language
NeXTCode is more than just a programming language; it's a movement to democratize coding. Inspired by mostly Visual Basic, Python, Julia and C++, NeXTCode is designed to be intuitive, powerful, and accessible, complete with a compiler, runtime, and SDK.

## üåê Contributions to the Tech Community
I believe in the power of programming languages to unlock endless possibilities. My vision is to create a language that transcends traditional boundaries, enabling us to build anything we can imagine. This ambition led to the invention of Hybrid visibility and accessibility in programming, a concept that revolutionizes how we interact with code and its components.

As a Young Computer Pioneer, my goal is to continue this legacy of innovation, making significant strides in the field of computer science. I am committed to developing technologies that not only advance our capabilities but also make them more accessible to a broader audience, fostering a future where anyone can turn their ideas into reality.
